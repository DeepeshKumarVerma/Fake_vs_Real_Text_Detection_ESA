# Fake_vs_Real_Text_Detection_LLM
A transformer-based system for detecting real vs. LLM-altered texts in ESA’s “Impostor Hunt” challenge. Each pair has one authentic and one manipulated document with subtle distortions. The project fine-tunes BERT to classify authenticity and support secure, reliable text validation in space-related operations.
